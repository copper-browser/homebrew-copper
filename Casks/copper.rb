  # Why auto_updates: Copper updates itself from the same GitHub releases (it
  # downloads and verifies the release in the background, then Settings ›
  # Updates swaps the bundle in and relaunches), so a plain `brew upgrade`
  # must not replace the bundle under a running Copper. Naming the cask still
  # upgrades it — `brew upgrade --cask copper` and `brew reinstall --cask
  # copper` remain the manual paths.

  # Why binary: expose the bundled `copper` CLI shim on PATH at install time.
  # It is rendered only when the built bundle actually ships the shim.
  binary "#{appdir}/Copper.app/Contents/Resources/bin/copper"

  # Why: the bundle is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID, no notarization),
  # so Gatekeeper refuses to launch it until the download quarantine flag is
  # cleared. `postflight_steps` (Homebrew ≥ 7.0.6) rather than the
  # deprecated `postflight` block; `brew install` updates Homebrew first.

  end

  # Why: Copper keeps its tab session and settings under its own Application
  # Support dir; WebKit keeps site data under the bundle id. Nothing here is
  # removed by a plain uninstall — only by `brew uninstall --zap`.
